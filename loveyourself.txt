you say love is messed up
you say that it don't work
you don't wanna try, no no
baby i'm no stranger edit by run
baby i'm no stranger edit by bt21
to heartbreak and the pain of
always being let go
And i know there's no making this right, this right
And i know there's no changing your mind, your mind
